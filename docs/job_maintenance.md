# Job Maintenance

Oban stores all jobs in the database, which offers several advantages:

- **Durability**: Jobs survive application restarts and crashes
- **Visibility**: Administrators can inspect job status and history
- **Accountability**: Complete audit trail of job execution

## Pruning Jobs

Oban automatically prunes `completed`, `cancelled`, and `discarded` jobs after a configurable
period (1 day, by default) to prevent the table from growing indefinitely. A pruner periodically
runs in the background to delete jobs that are in a final state and have exceeded the retention
period.

### Configuring Pruning

You can customize pruning behavior in `oban.toml`:

```toml
[pruner]
max_age = 3_600 # Keep jobs for 1 hour
limit = 50_000  # Delete up to 50k jobs per run
```

Or programmatically when running embedded:

```python
oban = Oban(
    pool=pool,
    queues={"default": 10},
    pruner={"max_age": 3_600, "limit": 50_000}
)
```

## Rescuing Jobs

During deployment or unexpected restarts, jobs may be left in an executing state indefinitely. We
call these jobs "orphans", but orphaning isn't a bad thing. It means that the job wasn't lost and
it may be retried again when the system comes back online.

The "lifeline" process automatically rescues orphaned jobs by periodically checking for jobs stuck
in the `executing` state for too long and moving them back to `available` so they can run again.

**Lifeline is enabled by default** and runs every 60 seconds, rescuing jobs that have been
executing for more than 5 minutes.

### How Rescue Works

Oban uses a **timeout-based rescue** strategy: jobs are rescued if their `attempted_at` timestamp
is older than the configured `rescue_after` threshold (default: 300 seconds). This approach works
reliably across node and doesn't require coordination between nodes.

For more accurate rescue that detects crashed producers immediately, and won't rescue jobs that
are still legitimately running, see [Oban Pro's Accurate Rescue][adoption].

### Configuring Lifeline

You can customize lifeline behavior in `oban.toml`:

```toml
[lifeline]
interval = 30       # Check for orphaned jobs every 30 seconds
rescue_after = 600  # Rescue jobs executing for more than 10 minutes
```

Or programmatically when running embedded:

```python
oban = Oban(
    pool=pool,
    queues={"default": 10},
    lifeline={"interval": 30, "rescue_after": 600}
)
```

### Choosing rescue_after

The `rescue_after` value should be longer than your longest-running job. If you have jobs that
legitimately run for 10 minutes, set `rescue_after` to at least 15 minutes (900 seconds) to avoid
premature rescue.

## Maintenance Guidelines

- All limits are soft; jobs beyond a specified age may not be pruned immediately after jobs
  complete. This means, pruning is best-effort and performed out-of-band.

- Pruning is only applied to jobs that are `completed`, `cancelled`, or `discarded`. It'll never
  delete jobs in an incomplete state.

- For high-volume systems, consider reducing `max_age` to keep the jobs table smaller, or
  increasing `limit` to prune more jobs per run.
